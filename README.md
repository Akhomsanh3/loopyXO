## How to make it work at home

1. Clone the repository (yes, that big green button at the top.) and navigate to the folder.

2. **In a Terminal**

```bash
$ yarn
# few lines down the road
$ gulp
```

This will open a browser window with your app dancing in it's DOM.

3. That's it. Now do whatever you want with it.

4. Deploy it to Github if you want to let the world see it. _boom-shaw-shey-upload_. :tada:
